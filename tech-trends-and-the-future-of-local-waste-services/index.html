  <div class="entry"><p><strong><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/paul_mackay.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-8004"><img class="wp-image-8004 alignleft" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/paul_mackay-300x300.jpg" alt="paul_mackay" width="150" height="150" /></a>by <a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/pauljmackay">Paul Mackay</a>, Technical Lead for the DCLG Local Waste Service Standards Project, with contributions from Lead Local Authority Project Advisor, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bencheetham">Ben Cheetham</a></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While our <a href="/product/local-waste-service-standards-project/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Local Waste Service Standards Project</a> is a small pilot project, it is the first to look at an established local service from end-to-end and try to map the way towards the interoperable, digital public service of the future. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This post discusses some ideas about how digital systems and common standards could be developed further across the waste industry, taking advantage of recent developments in Government as a Platform infrastructure and best practices in data management.</span></p>
<h3><b>Canonical taxonomies</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One idea we explored around November was whether the common taxonomies could have a canonical representation &#8211; a single origin &#8211; on a store such as </span><a href="http://opendatacommunities.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">opendatacommunities.org</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. These common taxonomies would be defined as linked data, and each term would have a URL. This official ‘canonical source’ is known in current tech jargon as a ‘canonical register’, or a ‘register’. I talked more about the taxonomies that could evolve into a canonical registers, such as the ‘missed collection events taxonomy’, in </span><a href="/what-our-technical-standards-mean-for-you/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">my last blog</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the fact that our small pilot couldn’t invest all its resource into perfecting one national register, the principle is a valid one, as highlighted by the recent launch of the </span><a href="https://country.register.gov.uk/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">countries register</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at Sprint 16. This is the first of many </span><a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2015/09/01/registers-authoritative-lists-you-can-trust/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">registers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> planned by GDS to provide </span><a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2015/11/03/making-data-a-public-asset-through-infrastructure/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data as infrastructure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, some of the building blocks that will help to unlock a wave of innovation and improved interoperability in the software that supports public services. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Registers are a logical way to create </span><a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2015/10/13/the-characteristics-of-a-register/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">canonical</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> datasets for things like waste materials, containers, bulky items, collection events and more. Currently, materials and waste types vary from the detailed, technical </span><a href="http://www.wastesupport.co.uk/ewc-codes/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">European Waste Codes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (similar to the SIC codes that are being </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">prototype</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">d</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a register) to the citizen-friendly </span><a href="https://communitiesuk.github.io/waste-service-standards/taxonomies/materials.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">materials list</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that we’ve sourced from </span><a href="http://www.wrap.org.uk/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">WRAP</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. At the moment, variants of these terms appear on hundreds of council websites. These arbitrarily diverse terms could, however, be brought together in some interlinked registers. If such registers were created, it would be a lot easier for the software that supports waste services to join up more effectively.</span></p>
<h3><b>Making existing tools more potent with registers</b></h3>
<h4><b>WasteDataFlow</b></h4>
<p><a href="http://www.wastedataflow.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">WasteDataFlow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a tool local authorities must use to report to </span><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-environment-food-rural-affairs"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Defra</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on their waste and recycling services. In our discovery workshops it came out strongly as a potential area for efficiency improvements, with councils spending from two days to two weeks reformatting and manually entering data into the compulsory reporting system approximately every three months &#8211; especially since the introduction of ‘question 100’. Question 100 requires authorities to enter information about where the material they collect ends up in much more detail than ever before. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By referring to canonical registers, </span><a href="http://www.wastedataflow.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">WasteDataFlow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> could help take the manual labour out of these reports and improve accuracy. For example, referring to a “waste premises” register (similar to this </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">food premises prototype</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">) that links the premises with other waste related information would allow councils to reference every waste processing site consistently, and to join up any data they have that refers to each site more automatically.</span></p>
<h4><b>Edoc</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More recently we learnt about </span><a href="https://www.edoconline.co.uk/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">edoc</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a service allowing councils and companies to consistently record what happens to the waste they produce and handle in line with statutory reporting requirements. Our understanding is that although its adoption is growing, it is not yet being used as widely as it should be. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By adopting common taxonomies or referring to common registers (based on the material and/or waste stream lists we’ve developed, for example), it would become easier for organisations to integrate these new tools into their workflow, creating a better national picture of how waste is flowing, and saving organisations money in reporting and analytics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some of the lists of terms or taxonomies that edoc uses, which might easily be defined as common, shared registers, which could in turn trigger more consistent and accessible terminology across the industry:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facility type</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pre-treatment option</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Material</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recovery/disposal code</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SIC code</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Waste container </span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Waste fate </span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Waste state </span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Waste stream</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other data categories in edoc are significant datasets in their own right and may well be launched as official national registers in the coming months. So, edoc could store a reference </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURIE"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CURIE</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or compact URI, rather than full details, which would all live in the canonical register against a reference e.g. ‘company:12345678’ for:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business (currently being </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">prototyped by GDS</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">)</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Local authority area (a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">starter register is provided by DCLG</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">)</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Site</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, there are a number of edoc components that are common to many local services such as “user” and “notification”. By defining these in a consistent way, councils and other organisations will be able to reuse the models or take advantage of scale through the use of national capabilities such as GOV.UK Verify and GOV.UK Notify.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I hope that for any future developments on WasteDataFlow and edoc, it will be possible to take advantage of data-as-infrastructure and use this to drive greater reuse and consistency of data across the industry.</span></p>
<h3><b>Circular economy</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The circular economy movement is exploding currently, from the </span><a href="https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ellen MacArthur Foundation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> driving global action to grassroots movements like </span><a href="https://oscedays.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open Source Circular Economy Days</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Despite these movements, and leadership from </span><a href="https://www.ciwm-journal.co.uk/london-to-take-circular-economy-leadership-role/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the City of London</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, global challenges of climate change and and the economic pressures to put more into landfill than the essentials means this movement faces an uphill challenge. At a Resource event last week, Liz Goodwin, CEO of WRAP, suggested that companies must make a “leap of faith” in adopting the circular economy, as many are talking about it but not enough are taking action. Councils have a leading role in promoting the circular economy with citizens as they are the first line in managing much of their unwanted resources.</span></p>
<h4><b>Recycle</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first step up the ladder is recycling, where quality levels could be improved and resource flows made more transparent. The Resource Association has created </span><a href="https://resourceassociation.com/reqip-recycling-quality-information-point"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ReQIP</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a specification of recycling quality that many reprocessors in the industry support. Codifying this in a machine readable format could make it easier for councils to offer guidance on how to avoid contamination and on what acceptable levels are. Reprocessor sites could publish any local variations from these common quality levels. Finally they could be compared against recorded levels of contamination measured from collections. </span></p>
<h4><b>Reuse</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many categories of resources such as bulky items (furniture, etc) are often reusable. Organisations like the </span><a href="http://www.frn.org.uk/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furniture Reuse Network</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="http://www.revolvereuse.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Revolve</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have created standards that their network members require from second hand items. If these were made open and widely available in a similar fashion to the ReQIP specifications, information for citizens could be made clearer and more consistent so they can make better choices about the best route for disposing of unwanted items.</span></p>
<h4><b>Reduce</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Almost by definition, to build a circular economy the whole product lifecycle must be considered to support ‘</span><a href="https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/circular-economy/interactive-diagram"><span style="font-weight: 400;">closing the loop</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">’ to create a zero-waste ecosystem. Manufacturers must build products that are durable, repairable and designed for disassembly. Standards have a vital role here too and BSI have kicked off a </span><a href="https://www.bsigroup.com/en-GB/standards/benefits-of-using-standards/becoming-more-sustainable-with-standards/Waste-Prevention-and-Circular-Economy-Project/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">circular economy standards</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> process to directly address some of these areas.</span></p>
<h3><b>Looking forward</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A recent report, “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Waste Data in the UK</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” launched last September looked at the role of data standards in driving the circular economy. As one of the “overarching initiatives” it identified a common glossary and data standards as important:</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A number of stakeholders, including the industry and all regulators mentioned that common data standards and a shared glossary across the sector would significantly improve the quality of current data sets by reducing inconsistency and enabling datasets to be matched and compared to improve intelligence and understanding. &#8230;</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This includes standardising fields such as the format of names and addresses, ensuring the use of six digit EWC codes and replacing free data fields with drop down lists.”</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Defra has recently launched a bold </span><a href="https://defradigital.blog.gov.uk/2015/06/25/opendefra/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">OpenDefra</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> initiative to release many datasets managed by Defra as open data, which includes significant waste and resource related data. If more organisations across the waste industry took a similar approach it has the potential to generate innovation, much as the example of TfL opening their data has delivered a 50x return on investment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In conclusion, it’s an exciting time for the waste management industry, and technology and standards have the potential to drive substantial and beneficial changes in the way we manage waste. We hope to see more of these pilots emerge, and we hope the sector continues to document their efforts and findings in the open (like this) so that all these great efforts compliment and build on each other.</span></p>
