<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The project aims to apply the Government Digital Service principles of best practice in service design to a local service problem &#8211; and this includes working through a number of phases: Discovery, Alpha, Beta and Live.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Beginning at the beginning</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m a big fan of starting a project with </span><a href="http://makeitquotidian.co.uk/2015/06/16/discovering-discovery/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a Discovery phase </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; it helps the team understand and prioritise the problems to solve and the needs to meet, before then sketching, testing and planning possible solutions. This is a process I’ve often run with small focused teams within organisations, but how would it work this scenario &#8211; across five different local authorities, as well as suppliers and other stakeholders, and with only a few months to complete it?</span></p>
<p>We wanted to get several things out of our Discovery phase:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Introduce the project &#8211; our methods and aims</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get to know people in the collaborating local authorities </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Introduce and use some agile user-centred techniques </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn about the context, needs and priorities of each authority </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understand their current technical and data set up </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hear from suppliers and understand their needs</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gather insight and thoughts from wider stakeholders</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Read across all five authorities to identify shared needs </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Share, discuss and prioritise these</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agree the plan for the first phase of delivery work (the “alpha” phase)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although this was an ambitious list it does fit with </span><a href="http://www.designcouncil.org.uk/news-opinion/design-process-what-double-diamond"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the usual shape of Discovery</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: learning and opening up your thinking, and then prioritising and focusing in on solutions and plans.</span></p>
<h3>Rinse and repeat</h3>
<p>We decided to cover the first five objectives in one go by spending a day with each of the collaborating authorities.  Although this was a lot to get out of one day we felt it would be an efficient use of everyone’s time &#8211; one big hit for the council rather than lots of meetings and emails.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/grp1.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-7950 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/grp1.png" alt="grp1" width="748" height="557" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/grp1.png 748w, https://www.localdigitalcoalition.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/grp1-300x223.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 748px) 100vw, 748px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caption</span><b>: The team at Brentwood enjoying biscuits and post-its </b></p>
<p>This meant the core team were repeating the same workshop five times in five different locations. We iterated and improve the approach each time, but we also needed to keep the fundamentals the same to ensure a fair read across all five at the end. This meant we couldn’t “inspect &amp; adapt” as much as we might have liked to &#8211; one of the side effects of running Discovery across five organisations rather than just one.</p>
<p>An alternative might have been to gather everyone for a big kick-off session covering the first three objectives on our list, followed by some homework and then more focused workshops at each council looking into technical detail. However getting that many people to one location at relatively short notice would have been a challenge, and also a big meeting followed by desk work might not have had the same impact as the individual Discovery days.</p>
<p>That’s because a lot of the benefits of Discovery come from walking through familiar services or scenarios from a new perspective.</p>
<h3>Deceptively simple</h3>
<p>On the face of it spending a day answering basic questions about a service, via post it notes, might not seem the best use of everyone’s time, but in every council we visited there were moments that made this worthwhile.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/grp2.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-7951 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/grp2.png" alt="grp2" width="743" height="549" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/grp2.png 743w, https://www.localdigitalcoalition.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/grp2-300x222.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 743px) 100vw, 743px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caption:</span><b> Capturing and mapping user needs on post-it notes</b></p>
<p>This is largely because we brought together people involved in all aspects of waste service delivery, to look at those services end-to-end and from the perspective of their users. This often led to new insights being shared or new connections being made which will hopefully bring benefits beyond our specific project.</p>
<p>It’s probably rare for the person renegotiating a big contract to spend a day with the people who answer the phones to citizens, or the people who are developing the website, or scheduling the rounds that the trucks go on. If you want to improve or redesign a service then you need to get a holistic view of it, and we hopefully gave everyone a taste of that in our workshops.</p>
<h3>The wider conversation</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also wanted to learn about the needs of the various suppliers involved in the delivery of waste services &#8211; from the companies that put the trucks on the road, through to startups building apps for citizens. </span><a href="/event/local-waste-service-standards-project-discovery-workshop-private-sector/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We ran a workshop</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> open to all suppliers, where we shared our initial thinking and asked them to walk through their current pain points, and also their current approach to data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also ran </span><a href="/event/local-waste-service-standards-project-discovery-workshop-public-sector/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a session for public sector stakeholders</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, asking them to think about the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats for our project and its aims and likely deliverables. Some of the participants were from other local authorities and it was reassuring to hear them reinforce some of the things we’d heard in our individual council workshops.</span></p>
<h3>Reading across</h3>
<p>The output of our Discovery process needed to be a prioritised set of “epics” &#8211; problems or needs that the delivery team could work on solving in the alpha phase. Having had all of our individual workshops with councils, plus the sessions with suppliers and stakeholders, we had a lot of material to digest.</p>
<p>We used various exercises (and spreadsheets!) to identify the common needs, and for each of these we asked:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s the evidence or justification for this?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which users (“personas”) does it relate to?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What might be the longer term benefits to the sector?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are the possible solutions?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What might be the dependencies?</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The good news is that this came down to 11 epics, which we pitched to a room of representatives from all the collaborating councils, for them to discuss and prioritise (<a href="/waste-standards-what-were-prioritising-and-why/">Linda O&#8217; Halloran has written a lot more about prioritising</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">). From this came a </span><a href="https://trello.com/b/Y9UKAdLG/local-waste-service-standards-backlog"><span style="font-weight: 400;">working backlog</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the team could take into delivery.</span></p>
<h3>Looking back</h3>
<p>If I were doing this again I might develop a more efficient way of gathering insight from the councils (perhaps asking them to prep more before the workshops), I might also create more space for suppliers and councils to come together to discuss the current pain points and possible opportunities.</p>
<p>However, given the time constraints, and the fact that none of us had attempted anything on this scale before, I think it was a successful process. We managed to achieve all of the things we set out to do, and to make new friends and connections along the way, and that to me is time well spent!</p>
<h3>What next?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The core team are now well into their alpha work, developing initial solutions to the needs that were prioritised. They’ll be sharing the outputs of this at a “show and tell” event in October. You can follow their detailed work on their </span><a href="https://trello.com/b/Y9UKAdLG/local-waste-service-standards-backlog"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trello board</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or keep across the headlines by keeping an eye on</span> <a href="/product/local-waste-service-standards-project/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the project page</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
